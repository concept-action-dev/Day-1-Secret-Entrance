# File: ./ Advent of Code-2025 / Day-1-Secret-Entrance / README.md

## Description

- A long list of values consist of the letter 'R' followed by a number or the letter 'L' followed by a number

- The Scenario is to imagine a combination lock with numbers ranging 0-99 and it begins pointing at 50

- The script needs to read each line and parse then use a conditional to output a positive or negative number based on R being a decrease and L being an increase

- Then the script will iterate through another loop using the output to increase and decrease using the listed values
-- in other words: the script would loop again for each line in the second file, and add the positive or negative value with each loop, and then it should total the number of times that the sum was zero

### Roadmap

- This is just a simple script for a December advent calendar of coding challenges. Hypothetically, if one were to work in improving this code, it could be nice to have an output that displays each sum. This output should just go into a text file and not be generated as console output because it could become extremely long if there were many inputs (as is the case with the advent challenge)  
- Any other ideas for changes or improvements can be listed here as well
